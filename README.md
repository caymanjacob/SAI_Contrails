# SAI_Contrails
The SAI project aims to reduce the environmental impact of contrails, which are condensation trails formed by airplanes at high altitudes. While contrails are often perceived as harmless clouds, they trap heat and contribute significantly to global warming. The project develops a system that helps airlines avoid creating contrails that amplify the greenhouse effect. By integrating this system into flight planning, it dynamically reroutes aircraft to avoid atmospheric conditions where "bad" contrails form, while promoting the formation of "good" contrails that scatter solar radiation and produce a cooling effect.

The system works through several key components:

Pre-flight Planning: Airlines use the platform to analyze upcoming flights, factoring in real-time weather data, air traffic, and atmospheric conditions:

Predictive Models: Using machine learning, the system predicts when and where contrails are likely to form and whether they will have a warming or cooling effect. These models are continuously updated based on new scientific data and actual flight results.
Rerouting Guidance: For a small percentage of flights (about 5%), the system recommends adjustments to altitude or slight changes in the route to avoid areas where "bad" contrails would form. These recommendations aim to minimize fuel burn and optimize environmental outcomes.
Real-time Adjustments: If weather conditions change mid-flight, the system can offer real-time route changes to pilots, helping them avoid generating contrails that trap heat.
Some of the benefits are:

Environmental Impact: The primary benefit is a reduction in the aviation industry's contribution to global warming by addressing contrails, which account for over one-third of its climate impact. Reducing "bad" contrails has a direct, measurable effect on the Earth’s radiative balance.
Cost Savings: Airlines can save on carbon credits, as avoiding contrails is cheaper than purchasing carbon credits tied to CO₂ emissions. For example, Delta Airlines spent $137 million on carbon credits in 2021; the system could reduce such expenses.
Fuel Efficiency: The rerouting strategies optimize flight paths in ways that balance contrail avoidance with fuel efficiency, preventing unnecessary fuel burn and lowering operational costs.
Regulatory Compliance: As regulations on aviation emissions tighten, particularly in markets like the EU and through initiatives such as CORSIA, adopting contrail reduction measures will help airlines comply with both carbon and non-carbon-related environmental standards.
The ultimate goal is to reduce the aviation industry's contribution to global warming by introducing contrail mitigation as a standard practice. By focusing on contrails, which are an overlooked but critical factor in climate change, SAI aims to:

Establish a broader understanding of the impact of non-CO₂ aviation emissions.
Push for contrail avoidance to be recognized within the carbon credit market, thereby providing airlines with financial incentives to reduce contrails.
Achieve widespread adoption of this technology across global airlines, making flight routes more environmentally friendly without compromising operational efficiency. In the long term, the project hopes to lead the aviation sector toward a more sustainable future​
